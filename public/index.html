  <meta name="description" content=" RITU is one of the top mettle fests of Kerala. Boastng over 2000 footfalls per day for the different events, RITU is a really unique and humongous technocultural
  fest that awes amd thrills everyone by its own stature. It is a beautiful amalgamation of different technical eventws and culutral extravaganzas,
  which holds up the legacy and granduer of RIT. And the fact that RITU is the most awaited technocultural fest in Kottayam, is a testimony in itself. 
  Prancing through the path illuminated by alumini, it is strenuous to match the caliber and legacy. However, with synergy and industriousness, we could outlive the expectations
  to date and hanker to pursue in the future." />
